# Gridded post-processor

[!["Latest release"](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/metno/gridpp.svg)](https://github.com/metno/gridpp/releases)

Gridpp a is post-processing tool for gridded weather forecasts. It consists of a **library** of commonly-used methods and a **command-line tool** that applies these methods to forecast fields in NetCDF files.

Gridpp is written in C++ but offers python bindings to the functions in the library. The tool is used at MET Norway to produce operational weather forecasts for Yr (https://www.yr.no).

Gridpp is currently under active development and the current version is a prototype for testing. Feedback
is welcome, either by using the issue tracker in Github, or by contacting Thomas Nipen (thomasn@met.no).

## Documentation
For information on how to use gridpp, check out the wiki at https://github.com/metno/gridpp/wiki.

## Features
- Methods for **downscaling** a forecast from a coarse grid to a fine grid
- Methods for **calibrating** a downscaled grid, such as quantile mapping
- Computationally efficient **neighbourhood** methods to compute neighbourhood min, mean, max, and any quantile.
- Data assimilation using **optimal interpolation** (OI) to merge observations and gridded forecasts (deterministic or ensemble)
- Efficient data structures for nearest location lookup in a vector or grid of locations
- Command-line client with support for Netcdf files with flexibility in how variables and dimensions are configured
